## Development scripts

### Dev

```bash
composer dev
```

This script will start a dev server at `http://localhost:5000` and use `samples/index.php` as the entry point.

### Test

```bash
composer test
```

### Update API docs

**Prerequisite**

- A `phpDocumentor.phar` in the project root (can be downloaded from [phpDocumentor](https://docs.phpdoc.org/guide/getting-started/installing.html)).
- Command `prettier` is available in the shell (an opinionated [code formatter](https://prettier.io/)), which can be installed with `npm install -g prettier`.

```bash
composer docs
```

This command will generate the API docs in `docs/api` folder and format the files.
